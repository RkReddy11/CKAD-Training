1. Blue-Green Deployment Strategy:

Explanation:
Blue-Green deployment is a technique to achieve zero-downtime deployments by maintaining two identical environments: the "Blue" environment (current version) and the "Green" environment (new version). Once the new version (Green) is tested and ready, traffic is switched from the old version (Blue) to the new version instantly. This approach ensures a smooth transition and allows you to roll back easily if any issues arise.

YAML Manifests:
Here's an example of how you can implement the Blue-Green deployment strategy in Kubernetes using Deployments and Services:

Step 1: Deploy the Blue (Current) Version

# blue-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: blue-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Step 2: Expose Blue Version with a Service

# blue-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: blue-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
    version: blue
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
Step 3: Deploy the Green (New) Version

# green-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: green-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
      version: green
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: green
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app:2.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Step 4: Expose Green Version with a Service

# green-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: green-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
    version: green
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
Step 5: Traffic Switch (Blue to Green)
Update the Service's selector to switch traffic to the new version:

kubectl apply -f green-service.yaml
kubectl delete service blue-app-service
2. Canary Deployment Strategy:

Explanation:
Canary deployment is a progressive rollout strategy where a new version is deployed to a small subset of users or servers, allowing you to test its performance in a real production environment before rolling it out to the entire user base. This approach helps identify any potential issues and reduces the impact of possible failures.

YAML Manifests:
Here's an example of how you can implement the Canary deployment strategy in Kubernetes using Deployments:

Step 1: Deploy the Canary Version (Limited Replicas)

# canary-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: canary-app
spec:
  replicas: 2   # Only 2 replicas for Canary version
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        version: canary
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app:2.0  # New version for Canary deployment
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
Step 2: Gradual Rollout of Canary Version
Increase the number of replicas for the Canary deployment over time to gradually expose more users to the new version:

kubectl apply -f canary-deployment.yaml
Step 3: Monitor and Validate
Monitor the performance and behavior of the Canary version. If it performs well and passes validation, proceed to the next step.

Step 4: Full Rollout or Rollback
If the Canary version performs well, increase the number of replicas for the main Deployment (Green version) to expose more users to the new version. If any issues arise during the Canary phase, quickly reduce the number of replicas or roll back to the previous version.

Note: In practice, you may need to use more sophisticated deployment strategies, such as traffic splitting and service mesh features, to perform canary deployments effectively. The examples above demonstrate the basic idea of Blue-Green and Canary deployments, but actual implementations may vary depending on your specific requirements and tools available in your Kubernetes ecosystem.
